\maketitle

\textsc{``That Maxwell's electrodynamics}---the way in which
it is usually understood---when applied to moving bodies,
leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in
the phenomena is well known.''\footnote{All quotations are
	from the translation of the paper by Arthur
	I.~Miller in the Appendix of his book \emph{Albert
	Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity}, as are the
	numbers for all equations.} Thus begins Einstein's
groundbreaking 1905 paper ``On the Electrodynamics of Moving
Bodies,'' the first presentation of the special theory of
relativity. After discussing an example of such 
asymmetry, Einstein writes this: 
\begin{quotation} 
	Examples of this sort, together with the
	unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the
	Earth relatively to the ``light medium,'' lead to
	the conjecture that to the phenomenon of absolute
	rest there correspond no properties of the
	phenomena, neither in mechanics, nor in
	electrodynamics, but rather that as has already been
	shown to quantities to the first order, for every
	reference system in which the laws of mechanics are
	valid, the laws of electrodynamics and optics are
	also valid.

	We will raise this conjecture (whose intent will
	from now on be referred to as the ``Principle of
	Relativity'') to a postulate, and moreover introduce
	another postulate, which is only apparently
	irreconcilable with the former: light is always
	propagated in empty space with a definite velocity
	$c$ which is independent of the state of motion of
	the emitting body. 
\end{quotation} 
The appearance of irreconcilability between these postulates
is evidently strong enough for Einstein, that he offers a
proof of their compatibility in \S3 of the
paper. Or so he claims---and my purpose in this essay will
be to determine whether the claim is true; and if so, in
what sense. Did Einstein indeed prove the postulates
compatible, and if so, how? 
\section{The proof}
Einstein introduces his proof as follows:
\begin{quote}
	We now have to prove that any ray of light, measured
	in the moving system, is propagated with the
	velocity $c$, if, as we have assumed, this is the
	case in the resting system; for we have not as yet
	furnished the proof that the principle of the
	constancy of the velocity of light is compatible
	with the principle of relativity.
\end{quote}
By introducing his proof this way, there seem to be at least
three questions that Einstein takes his paper to have 
already answered, along with a fourth we can raise at this
point to understand the necessity, or at least the
desirability, of such a proof: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the resting system?
	\item What is the moving system?
	\item Why would proving what Einstein says we now have to
		prove, about $c$ being the velocity of any
		ray of light in the moving system if $c$ is
		its velocity in the resting system, prove in turn
		that the principle of this velocity's constancy 
		is compatible with the
		principle of relativity? 
	\item Why is the proof needed? That is, why might
		we think, until a proof shows us otherwise,
		that these principles were incompatible?
\end{enumerate}
It looks as if answers to all four questions can be
readily given as early as the beginning of \S2 of the paper,
given how Einstein formulates the definitions he offers
there of the principles in question:
\begin{quotation}
	1. The laws by which the states of physical systems
	undergo changes are independent of whether those
	changes of state are referred to one or the other of
	two coordinate systems moving relatively to each
	other in uniform translational motion.
	
	2. Any ray of light moves in the ``resting''
	coordinate system with the definite velocity $c$,
	which is independent of whether the ray was emitted
	by a resting or by a moving body. %Note later the
	% last part of this definition about the time
	%interval
\end{quotation} The resting system, then, is the coordinate
system in which any ray of light moves at $c$, independently
of any motion in the source of the ray. The moving system,
in turn, is any coordinate system in uniform translational
motion relative to the resting system, where either system
can serve as reference for any law of physics. We can also
infer that if the two principles were incompatible, then we
could rightly say that any ray of light moves at $c$ in the
resting system according to the one principle, but would be
wrong to infer that it therefore moves at $c$ in the moving
system according to the other principle. Proving the
principles compatible, then, would seem to mean showing that
the inference in this case is sound. It means proving that
if any ray of light moves at $c$ in the resting system, then
it indeed moves at $c$ in the moving system---just as
Einstein says when he begins his proof. 

But before moving on the details of this proof, there is yet
a fourth question, I think, that is answered implicitly by
Einstein's definitions of these principles and worth
mentioning since it shows why he thought a proof was needed:
why are the principles, as Einstein says in his
introduction, apparently irreconciliable? [Identify any
moving system with a moving source of light.]

Mathematically, the proof simply
involves the derivation of this equation \begin{align} \xi^2
	+ \eta^2 + \zeta^2 = c^2\tau^2
	\tag{\S3.17}\label{eq:3.17}\end{align} from this one
\begin{align}  x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2 t^2.
	\tag{\S3.16}\label{eq:3.16} \end{align}
Non-mathematically, The interpretation of this derivation is
also simple, given Einstein's suppositions for .
(\ref{eq:3.16}). means that light has traveled a distance
$ct$ at any point $(x,y,z)$ reached in a reference system
$K$ if (1) $K$ is taken to be at rest relative to another
reference system $\kappa$ taken to be in uniform translation
motion; (2) light is emitted from the origin of both sty
supposed at rest,results from a pair of suppositions: (1)
that we have emitted light in all directions The proof seems
to work as follows.  Einstein supposes that light is emitted
in all directions, thus in the form of a spherical wave,
from the origin of both a reference system $K$ at rest and a
reference system $\kappa$ in uniform translational motion to
$K$. He further supposes, presumably in accordance with the
second postulate he mentions in the introduction of the
paper, that light moves at $c$ in $K$. From these
suppositions it follows that for any point $(x,y,z)$ reached
by the wave at time $t$ in $K$, the distance from that point
back to origin ($ct$) will satisfy the Pythagorean theorem
in three dimensions. Thus: The proof is finished, according
to Einstein, by transforming this equation with the
equations of transformation he derived earlier in the paper,
and doing what he calls "a simple calculation" (presumably
because it involves only steps---albeit many steps---of
algebraic manipulation). For so transformed, the equation is
now this:  Thus, any point reached by light in $K$, in
satisfying the first equation, satisfies the second equation
as well, being a point $(\xi,\eta,\zeta)$ reached by the
wave at time $\tau$ in $\kappa$, having traveled a distance
$(c\tau)$ from $\kappa$'s origin by thus moving at $c$, the
speed of light. Or as Einstein interprets the result:
\begin{quote} The wave under consideration is therefore no
	less a spherical wave with velocity of propagation
	$c$ when considered in the moving system.
	Consequently our two fundamental principles are
	compatible with each other.  \end{quote}

% Start here: The first sentence is understandable enough. But what about the
% second one?  Start here, by raising a question about why this derivation, and
% more specifically, this derivation as Einstein does it through his
% transformation equations and simple calculation, counts as a proof of the
% compatibility of the postulates.

reached a reached by the wave ere 

( For anyne way of
understanding the first part of the paper proper, from \S1 through little more
than halfEinstein offers his ``proof'' that the two postulates are compatible,
he does it by deriving this equation,


from this one,
Einstein calls the calculation behind this derivation ``simple''. But there
would seem a still simpler proof of compatibility, involving no such
calculation in the derivation. 

First, we assume that light moves at $c$ in resting system $K$, as
required by the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light. Thus,
a ray of light emitted along the axes of $K$ will satisfy the following
equations: 
\begin{align*}
	x=ct\\
	y=ct\\
	z=ct
\end{align*}
Moreover, any other ray of light emitted from the origin of $K$ can be 
expressed by the ordered triple of $K$ co-ordinates $(x,y,z)$, and
understood to satisfy the distance formula $x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2t^2$.

Next, we assume that if light moves at $c$ in resting system $K$, then it
moves at $c$ in moving system $\kappa$, as 
required by the principle of relativity. Thus, if a ray of light emitted along
the axes of $K$ satisfied the previous equations, then a ray of light emitted along the
axes of $\kappa$ will satisfy the following equations:
\begin{align*} \xi=c\tau\\
\eta=c\tau\\ \zeta=c\tau \end{align*}

Moreover, any other ray of light emitted
from the origin of $\kappa$ can be expressed by the ordered triple of $\kappa$
coordinates $(\xi,\eta,\zeta)$, and understood to satisfy the distance formula
$\xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2=c^2\tau^2$.

Our two assumptions, then, are (1) that this equation holds:
\begin{align*}
x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2 t^2;
\end{align*}
and (2) that if that equation holds, then this equation holds:
\begin{align*}
\xi^2 + \eta^2 + \zeta^2 = c^2\tau^2;
\end{align*}
from which it follows, taking both assumptions together, that the latter
equation holds:
\begin{align*}
\xi^2 + \eta^2 + \zeta^2 = c^2\tau^2.
\end{align*}

% Go on to ask why Einstein bothers with the calculation. Use quote to show
% he is taking the compatibility proof to be of the second assumption, that is,
% to assume the proposition required by one postulate, and prove the proposition
% required by the other postulate. But why do that? Leave that question for
% later, go on to discuss circularity.

But why, then, does Einstein bother with a derivation? Presumably 
because he takes a compatibility proof of the postulates to require more than
the mere assumption of both postulates at once. And he seems to say as much
when he introduces the proof:
\begin{quote}
	We now have to prove that any ray of light, measured in the moving
	system, is propagated with velocity $c$, if, as we have assumed,
	this is the case in the resting system; for we have not yet
	furnished the proof that the principle of the constancy of the
	velocity of light is compatible with the principle of relativity.
\end{quote}
It looks as if Einstein takes a compatibility proof in this case to mean
that we assume only that light moves at $c$ in resting system $K$, as required by
the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, but \emph{prove} on this
assumption that light moves at $c$ in moving system $\kappa$, as required by the
principle of relativity. ssume the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light in
the resting system, prove
	Or to put the point in the
terms that he himself uses to introduce the proof: he takes a compatibility
proof in this case to require that we assume only that light move at $c$ in
$K$, but \emph{prove} on that assumption that light move at $c$ in $\kappa$.

Looks as if we can assume both without contradiction, so the two principles
are compatible. Why doesn't Einstein do it this way? Without the derivation.

Note as well that the derivation seems to be if light moves at c in K,
it will moves at c in kappa. We don't assume both at once, but just that
light moves at c in K, then "find out" through the derivation that it
travels at c in kappa.
Answer, there is something in the first principle left out of the proof, that
makes the principles seem to be incompatible.

Circularity would seem to be that we assume light travels at c in kappa. But
Einstein assumes this in his actual approach.

Put the point this way: Einstein makes no assumption that the principle
of relativity holds for the transformation equations insofar as they
are transformation equations. Instead the assumption is: if light
travels at velocity c in kappa as measured in kappa, then it will not travel
at c as measured in K. Or the other way around, if light travels at
velocity c in kappa as measured in K, it will not travel at c in kappa
as measured in K.
