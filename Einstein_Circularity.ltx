\maketitle

When Einstein offers his ``proof'' that the two postulates are compatible, he
does it by deriving this equation,

\begin{align*}
\xi^2 + \eta^2 + \zeta^2 = c^2\tau^2
\end{align*}
from this one,
\begin{align*}
x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2 t^2.
\end{align*}

Einstein calls the calculation behind this derivation ``simple''. But there
would seem a still simpler proof of compatibility, involving no such
calculation in the derivation. 

First, we assume that light moves at $c$ in resting system $K$, as
required by the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light. Thus,
a ray of light emitted along the axes of $K$ will satisfy the following
equations: 
\begin{align*}
	x=ct\\
	y=ct\\
	z=ct
\end{align*}
Moreover, any other ray of light emitted from the origin of $K$ can be 
expressed by the ordered triple of $K$ co-ordinates $(x,y,z)$, and
understood to satisfy the distance formula $x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2t^2$.

Next, we assume that if light moves at $c$ in resting system $K$, then it
moves at $c$ in moving system $\kappa$, as 
required by the principle of relativity. Thus, if a ray of light emitted along
the axes of $K$ satisfied the previous equations, then a ray of light emitted along the
axes of $\kappa$ will satisfy the following equations:
\begin{align*} \xi=c\tau\\
\eta=c\tau\\ \zeta=c\tau \end{align*}

Moreover, any other ray of light emitted
from the origin of $\kappa$ can be expressed by the ordered triple of $\kappa$
coordinates $(\xi,\eta,\zeta)$, and understood to satisfy the distance formula
$\xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2=c^2\tau^2$.

Our two assumptions, then, are (1) that this equation holds:
\begin{align*}
x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2 t^2;
\end{align*}
and (2) that if that equation holds, then this equation holds:
\begin{align*}
\xi^2 + \eta^2 + \zeta^2 = c^2\tau^2;
\end{align*}
from which it follows, taking both assumptions together, that the latter
equation holds:
\begin{align*}
\xi^2 + \eta^2 + \zeta^2 = c^2\tau^2.
\end{align*}

% Go on to ask why Einstein bothers with the calculation. Use quote to show
% he is taking the compatibility proof to be of the second assumption, that is,
% to assume the proposition required by one postulate, and prove the proposition
% required by the other postulate. But why do that? Leave that question for
% later, go on to discuss circularity.

But why, then, does Einstein bother with a derivation? Presumably 
because he takes a compatibility proof of the postulates to require more than
the mere assumption of both postulates at once. And he seems to say as much
when he introduces the proof:
\begin{quote}
	We now have to prove that any ray of light, measured in the moving
	system, is propagated with velocity $c$, if, as we have assumed,
	this is the case in the resting system; for we have not yet
	furnished the proof that the principle of the constancy of the
	velocity of light is compatible with the principle of relativity.
\end{quote}
It looks as if Einstein takes a compatibility proof in this case to mean
that we assume only that light moves at $c$ in resting system $K$, as required by
the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, but \emph{prove} on this
assumption that light moves at $c$ in moving system $\kappa$, as required by the
principle of relativity. ssume the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light in
the resting system, prove
	Or to put the point in the
terms that he himself uses to introduce the proof: he takes a compatibility
proof in this case to require that we assume only that light move at $c$ in
$K$, but \emph{prove} on that assumption that light move at $c$ in $\kappa$.

Looks as if we can assume both without contradiction, so the two principles
are compatible. Why doesn't Einstein do it this way? Without the derivation.

Note as well that the derivation seems to be if light moves at c in K,
it will moves at c in kappa. We don't assume both at once, but just that
light moves at c in K, then "find out" through the derivation that it
travels at c in kappa.
Answer, there is something in the first principle left out of the proof, that
makes the principles seem to be incompatible.

Circularity would seem to be that we assume light travels at c in kappa. But
Einstein assumes this in his actual approach.

Put the point this way: Einstein makes no assumption that the principle
of relativity holds for the transformation equations insofar as they
are transformation equations. Instead the assumption is: if light
travels at velocity c in kappa as measured in kappa, then it will not travel
at c as measured in K. Or the other way around, if light travels at
velocity c in kappa as measured in K, it will not travel at c in kappa
as measured in K.
