\title{Einstein's Proof in \S3 of ``On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies''}

\maketitle

\textsc{``That Maxwell's electrodynamics}---the way in which it is usually
understood---when applied to moving bodies, leads to asymmetries which do not
appear to be inherent in the phenomena is well known.'' Thus begins Einstein's
groundbreaking 1905 paper ``On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,'' the
first presentation of the special theory of relativity. After discussing an
example of such an asymmetry, Einstein writes this:
\begin{quotation}
Examples of this sort, together with the unsuccessful attempts to discover any
motion of the Earth relatively to the ``light medium,'' lead to the conjecture
that to the phenomenon of absolute rest there correspond no properties of the
phenomena, neither in mechanics, nor in electrodynamics, but rather that as
has already been shown to quantities to the first order, for every reference
system in which the laws of mechanics are valid, the laws of electrodynamics
and optics are also valid.

We will raise this conjecture (whose intent will from now on be referred to as
the ``Principle of Relativity'') to a postulate, and moreover introduce another
postulate, which is only apparently irreconcilable with the former: light is
always propagated in empty space with a definite velocity $c$ which is
independent of the state of motion of the emitting body.  \end{quotation} 

The appearance of irreconcilability between these postulates is evidently
strong enough for Einstein that he offers what he calls \emph{a proof} of their
compatibility in \S3 of the paper. The proof seems to work as follows.
Einstein supposes that light is emitted in all directions, thus in the form of
a spherical wave, from the origin of both a reference system $K$ at rest and a
reference system $\kappa$ in uniform translational motion to $K$. He further
supposes, presumably in accordance with the second postulate he mentions in the
introduction of the paper, that light moves at $c$ in $K$. From these
suppositions it follows that for any point $(x,y,z)$ reached by the wave at
time $t$ in $K$, the distance from that point back to origin ($ct$) will
satisfy the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions. Thus: \begin{align*}
x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2 t^2.  \end{align*} The proof is finished, according to
Einstein, by transforming this equation with the equations of transformation he
derived earlier in the paper, and doing what he calls "a simple calculation"
(presumably because it involves only steps---albeit many steps---of algebraic
manipulation). For so transformed, the equation is now this: \begin{align*}
\xi^2 + \eta^2 + \zeta^2 = c^2\tau^2. \end{align*} Thus, any point
reached by light in $K$, in satisfying the first equation, satisfies the second
equation as well, being a point $(\xi,\eta,\zeta)$ reached by
the wave at time $\tau$ in $\kappa$, having traveled a distance $(c\tau)$ from
$\kappa$'s origin by thus moving at $c$, the speed of light. Or as Einstein
interprets the result: \begin{quote} The wave under consideration is therefore
no less a spherical wave with velocity of propagation $c$ when considered in
the moving system. Consequently our two fundamental principles are compatible
with each other.  \end{quote}

% Start here: The first sentence is understandable enough. But what about the
% second one?  Start here, by raising a question about why this derivation, and
% more specifically, this derivation as Einstein does it through his
% transformation equations and simple calculation, counts as a proof of the
% compatibility of the postulates.

( For anyne way of
understanding the first part of the paper proper, from \S1 through little more
than halfEinstein offers his ``proof'' that the two postulates are compatible,
he does it by deriving this equation,


from this one,
Einstein calls the calculation behind this derivation ``simple''. But there
would seem a still simpler proof of compatibility, involving no such
calculation in the derivation. 

First, we assume that light moves at $c$ in resting system $K$, as
required by the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light. Thus,
a ray of light emitted along the axes of $K$ will satisfy the following
equations: 
\begin{align*}
	x=ct\\
	y=ct\\
	z=ct
\end{align*}
Moreover, any other ray of light emitted from the origin of $K$ can be 
expressed by the ordered triple of $K$ co-ordinates $(x,y,z)$, and
understood to satisfy the distance formula $x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2t^2$.

Next, we assume that if light moves at $c$ in resting system $K$, then it
moves at $c$ in moving system $\kappa$, as 
required by the principle of relativity. Thus, if a ray of light emitted along
the axes of $K$ satisfied the previous equations, then a ray of light emitted along the
axes of $\kappa$ will satisfy the following equations:
\begin{align*} \xi=c\tau\\
\eta=c\tau\\ \zeta=c\tau \end{align*}

Moreover, any other ray of light emitted
from the origin of $\kappa$ can be expressed by the ordered triple of $\kappa$
coordinates $(\xi,\eta,\zeta)$, and understood to satisfy the distance formula
$\xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2=c^2\tau^2$.

Our two assumptions, then, are (1) that this equation holds:
\begin{align*}
x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2 t^2;
\end{align*}
and (2) that if that equation holds, then this equation holds:
\begin{align*}
\xi^2 + \eta^2 + \zeta^2 = c^2\tau^2;
\end{align*}
from which it follows, taking both assumptions together, that the latter
equation holds:
\begin{align*}
\xi^2 + \eta^2 + \zeta^2 = c^2\tau^2.
\end{align*}

% Go on to ask why Einstein bothers with the calculation. Use quote to show
% he is taking the compatibility proof to be of the second assumption, that is,
% to assume the proposition required by one postulate, and prove the proposition
% required by the other postulate. But why do that? Leave that question for
% later, go on to discuss circularity.

But why, then, does Einstein bother with a derivation? Presumably 
because he takes a compatibility proof of the postulates to require more than
the mere assumption of both postulates at once. And he seems to say as much
when he introduces the proof:
\begin{quote}
	We now have to prove that any ray of light, measured in the moving
	system, is propagated with velocity $c$, if, as we have assumed,
	this is the case in the resting system; for we have not yet
	furnished the proof that the principle of the constancy of the
	velocity of light is compatible with the principle of relativity.
\end{quote}
It looks as if Einstein takes a compatibility proof in this case to mean
that we assume only that light moves at $c$ in resting system $K$, as required by
the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, but \emph{prove} on this
assumption that light moves at $c$ in moving system $\kappa$, as required by the
principle of relativity. ssume the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light in
the resting system, prove
	Or to put the point in the
terms that he himself uses to introduce the proof: he takes a compatibility
proof in this case to require that we assume only that light move at $c$ in
$K$, but \emph{prove} on that assumption that light move at $c$ in $\kappa$.

Looks as if we can assume both without contradiction, so the two principles
are compatible. Why doesn't Einstein do it this way? Without the derivation.

Note as well that the derivation seems to be if light moves at c in K,
it will moves at c in kappa. We don't assume both at once, but just that
light moves at c in K, then "find out" through the derivation that it
travels at c in kappa.
Answer, there is something in the first principle left out of the proof, that
makes the principles seem to be incompatible.

Circularity would seem to be that we assume light travels at c in kappa. But
Einstein assumes this in his actual approach.

Put the point this way: Einstein makes no assumption that the principle
of relativity holds for the transformation equations insofar as they
are transformation equations. Instead the assumption is: if light
travels at velocity c in kappa as measured in kappa, then it will not travel
at c as measured in K. Or the other way around, if light travels at
velocity c in kappa as measured in K, it will not travel at c in kappa
as measured in K.
