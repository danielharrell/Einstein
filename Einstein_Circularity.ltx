\title{Einstein's Proof in \S3 of ``On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies''}
\author{Daniel Harrell}
\begin{document}
\maketitle

\textsc{``That Maxwell's electrodynamics}---the way in which
it is usually understood---when applied to moving bodies,
leads to asymmetries which do not appear to be inherent in
the phenomena is well known.''\footnote{All quotations are
	from the translation of the paper by Arthur
	I.~Miller in the Appendix of his book \emph{Albert
	Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity}, as are the
	numbers for all equations.} Thus begins Einstein's
groundbreaking 1905 paper ``On the Electrodynamics of Moving
Bodies,'' the first presentation of the special theory of
relativity. After discussing an example of such 
asymmetry, Einstein writes this: 
\begin{quotation} 
	Examples of this sort, together with the
	unsuccessful attempts to discover any motion of the
	Earth relatively to the ``light medium,'' lead to
	the conjecture that to the phenomenon of absolute
	rest there correspond no properties of the
	phenomena, neither in mechanics, nor in
	electrodynamics, but rather that as has already been
	shown to quantities to the first order, for every
	reference system in which the laws of mechanics are
	valid, the laws of electrodynamics and optics are
	also valid.

	We will raise this conjecture (whose intent will
	from now on be referred to as the ``Principle of
	Relativity'') to a postulate, and moreover introduce
	another postulate, which is only apparently
	irreconcilable with the former: light is always
	propagated in empty space with a definite velocity
	$c$ which is independent of the state of motion of
	the emitting body. 
\end{quotation} 
The appearance of irreconcilability between these postulates
is evidently strong enough for Einstein, that he offers a
proof of their compatibility in \S3 of the
paper. Or so he claims---and my purpose in this essay will
be to determine whether the claim is true; and if so, in
what sense. Did Einstein indeed prove the postulates
compatible, and if so, how? 
\section{The Proof}
Einstein introduces his proof as follows:
\begin{quote}
	We now have to prove that any ray of light, measured
	in the moving system, is propagated with the
	velocity $c$, if, as we have assumed, this is the
	case in the resting system; for we have not as yet
	furnished the proof that the principle of the
	constancy of the velocity of light is compatible
	with the principle of relativity.
\end{quote}
By introducing his proof this way, there seem to be at least
three questions that Einstein takes his paper to have 
already answered, along with a fourth we can raise at this
point to understand the necessity, or at least the
desirability, of such a proof: 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item What is the resting system?
	\item What is the moving system?
	\item Why would proving what Einstein says we now have to
		prove, about $c$ being the velocity of any
		ray of light in the moving system if $c$ is
		its velocity in the resting system, prove in turn
		that the principle of this velocity's constancy 
		is compatible with the
		principle of relativity? 
	\item Why is the proof needed? That is, why might
		we think, until a proof shows us otherwise,
		that these principles were incompatible?
\end{enumerate}
It looks as if answers to all four questions can be
readily given as early as the beginning of \S2 of the paper,
given how Einstein formulates the definitions he offers
there of the principles in question (hereafter labelled
``P1'' and ``P2''):
\begin{quotation}
	1. The laws by which the states of physical systems
	undergo changes are independent of whether those
	changes of state are referred to one or the other of
	two coordinate systems moving relatively to each
	other in uniform translational motion.
	
	2. Any ray of light moves in the ``resting''
	coordinate system with the definite velocity $c$,
	which is independent of whether the ray was emitted
	by a resting or by a moving body. %Note later the
	% last part of this definition about the time
	%interval
\end{quotation} 

The resting system, then, is the coordinate
system in which any ray of light moves at $c$, independently
of any motion in the source of the ray, according to P2. The
moving system, in turn, is any coordinate system in uniform
translational motion relative to the resting system; and
where, according to P1, either system can serve as reference
for any law of physics---in particular, the law stated in
P2. 

But then it would seem as if the principles were
incompatible. For suppose that the source of a ray of light
were moving at velocity $v$ in the direction of the ray.
This source would therefore move at $v$ in the resting
system, yet be at rest in a moving system: the system moving
at $v$ in the direction of the ray, relative to the resting
system. In both systems, according to P1, we should infer that this ray is
moving at $c$. But to infer it moves at $c$
in the moving system would seem to violate P2. For it
would then move at $c$ relative to its moving source, as if
dependent on it.  And according to P2, but now in violation
of P1, it seems we should say that the ray of light is
moving at $c$ in the resting system but $c-v$ in the moving
system. Similarly, if the ray were moving directly against the
motion of its source, it seems we should say that the ray is
moving again at $c$ in the resting system, but now at $c+v$
in the moving system. Proving the principles compatible, then, would seem to mean
showing that such inferences from P2 are wrong.  It would
mean showing that if the ray in question---and more
generally, if \emph{any} ray---is moving at $c$ in the
resting system (according to P2), it will indeed be moving
at $c$ in the moving system (in accordance with P1).  

And
this is exactly what Einstein says we now have to prove when
he introduces his proof in \S3, quoted above.  On this same
level of description, moreover, the proof is simple---and
seemingly sound. Einstein supposes that light is emitted in
all directions from the origin of both systems. He further
supposes, in accordance with P2, that every ray is
moving at $c$ in the resting system, so forming
a spherical wave. Thus, he infers, for every point
$(x,y,z)$ reached by the wave at time $t$ in the resting
system, the
distance $ct$ from that point back to origin will satisfy
the Pythagorean theorem in three dimensions:
\begin{align}  x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2 t^2.
	\tag{\S3.16}\label{eq:3.16} \end{align}

Now, if P2 were incompatible with P1, we should not expect
this wave to be spherical in the moving system, but
lopsided, since we will expect the ray moving directly with
the moving system to have a velocity of $c-v$, the ray
moving directly against this system a velocity of $c+v$, and
every other ray its own velocity between $c-v$ and $c+v$ as
determined by its direction. And in that case the wave would
\emph{not} satisfy the Pythagorean theorem \begin{align}
\xi^2 + \eta^2 + \zeta^2 = c^2\tau^2.
\tag{\S3.17}\label{eq:3.17}\end{align}for every point
$(\xi,\eta,\zeta)$ reached at $\tau$ in the moving system,
according to its own spatio-temporal coordinates (and for
which Einstein uses the Greek letters given here). This
expectation is underlined, moreover, by the equations
relating coordinates between the systems. For if these
equations were simple, \begin{align} \tau=t \quad \xi=x \quad \eta=y
\quad \zeta=z,\label{eq:simple} \end{align} then, contrary to
our expectation, \ref{eq:3.17} would follow from
\ref{eq:3.16} as a matter of simple substitution. But
$\tau\neq t$, as Einstein concludes in \S2, on the simplest
definition of what it means for time-measuring ``clocks'' 
to be synchronous in either system, yet are thereby
precluded, so Einstein shows, from being synchronous across
systems. And this forces Einstein in \S3 to derive a more
complex set of coordinate-relating equations than
(\ref{eq:simple}), \begin{align}
\tau&=\phi(v)\beta(t-vx/c^2) \tag{\S3.11}\label{eq:3.11}\\
\xi&=\phi(v)\beta(x-vt) \tag{\S3.12}\\ \eta&=\phi(v)y
\tag{\S3.13}\\ \zeta&=\phi(v)z \tag{\S3.14}\label{eq:3.14},
\end{align} where $c$ is the velocity of light in the
resting system, $v$ is the velocity of the moving system
in relation to the resting system,
$\beta=1/(\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2)}$, and $\phi(v)$ is a function
that Einstein calls ``as yet unknown.'' That this unknown
function is shared by all these equations
is an index of how
improbable it would seem for  
\ref{eq:3.17} to follow from \ref{eq:3.16} by their
application. For aren't there too many non-coordinate
terms in the equations---and one unknown such term 
at that---to allow for it?  

The answer to this question, however, turns out to be
``no,'' as Einstein indicates just after calling $\phi(v)$
unknown. For if we do transform \ref{eq:3.16} using
\ref{eq:3.11}--\ref{eq:3.14}, so Einstein remarks, we obtain
\ref{eq:3.17} from ``a simple calculation.'' And indeed the
derivation requires nothing more than algebra (albeit many
steps of algebra---see \ref{sec:Derivation})

right before embarking upon his proof. 

--to preclude
of far
more complex such equations
Einstein has derivedOf course, if
the coordinates of both systems were related by equations as
simple as these,Moreover, we
can readily confirm this suspicion by using the
transformation equations for coordinates that Einstein
derives just before this point in \S3,
But it turns out that the wave \emph{does} satisfy the
theorem in the moving system. For when we actually transform
\ref{eq:3.16} from the coordinates of the resting system to
those of the moving system, [mention the equations here
	along
with the simple calculation] the result is this:
 Thus, for every point
$(\xi,\eta,\zeta)$ reached by the wave at time $\tau$ in the
moving system, the distance from that point back to origin
is always $c\tau$. Or as Einstein characterizes the
seemingly successful result of the proof: \begin{quote} The
	wave under consideration is therefore no less a
	spherical wave with velocity of propagation $c$ when
	considered in the moving system. Consequently our
two fundamental principles are compatible with each other.
\end{quote} \section{The Problem} from this one
Non-mathematically, The interpretation of this derivation is
also simple, given Einstein's suppositions for .
(\ref{eq:3.16}). means that light has traveled a distance
$ct$ at any point $(x,y,z)$ reached in a reference system
$K$ if (1) $K$ is taken to be at rest relative to another
reference system $\kappa$ taken to be in uniform translation
motion; (2) light is emitted from the origin of both sty

that we have emitted light in all directions The proof seems
to work as follows.  % Start here: The first sentence is

reached a reached by the wave ere 

( For anyne way of
understanding the first part of the paper proper, from \S1 through little more
than halfEinstein offers his ``proof'' that the two postulates are compatible,
he does it by deriving this equation,


from this one,
Einstein calls the calculation behind this derivation ``simple''. But there
would seem a still simpler proof of compatibility, involving no such
calculation in the derivation. 

First, we assume that light moves at $c$ in resting system $K$, as
required by the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light. Thus,
a ray of light emitted along the axes of $K$ will satisfy the following
equations: 
\begin{align*}
	x=ct\\
	y=ct\\
	z=ct
\end{align*}
Moreover, any other ray of light emitted from the origin of $K$ can be 
expressed by the ordered triple of $K$ co-ordinates $(x,y,z)$, and
understood to satisfy the distance formula $x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2t^2$.

Next, we assume that if light moves at $c$ in resting system $K$, then it
moves at $c$ in moving system $\kappa$, as 
required by the principle of relativity. Thus, if a ray of light emitted along
the axes of $K$ satisfied the previous equations, then a ray of light emitted along the
axes of $\kappa$ will satisfy the following equations:
\begin{align*} \xi=c\tau\\
\eta=c\tau\\ \zeta=c\tau \end{align*}

Moreover, any other ray of light emitted
from the origin of $\kappa$ can be expressed by the ordered triple of $\kappa$
coordinates $(\xi,\eta,\zeta)$, and understood to satisfy the distance formula
$\xi^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2=c^2\tau^2$.

Our two assumptions, then, are (1) that this equation holds:
\begin{align*}
x^2+y^2+z^2=c^2 t^2;
\end{align*}
and (2) that if that equation holds, then this equation holds:
\begin{align*}
\xi^2 + \eta^2 + \zeta^2 = c^2\tau^2;
\end{align*}
from which it follows, taking both assumptions together, that the latter
equation holds:
\begin{align*}
\xi^2 + \eta^2 + \zeta^2 = c^2\tau^2.
\end{align*}

% Go on to ask why Einstein bothers with the calculation. Use quote to show
% he is taking the compatibility proof to be of the second assumption, that is,
% to assume the proposition required by one postulate, and prove the proposition
% required by the other postulate. But why do that? Leave that question for
% later, go on to discuss circularity.

But why, then, does Einstein bother with a derivation? Presumably 
because he takes a compatibility proof of the postulates to require more than
the mere assumption of both postulates at once. And he seems to say as much
when he introduces the proof:
\begin{quote}
	We now have to prove that any ray of light, measured in the moving
	system, is propagated with velocity $c$, if, as we have assumed,
	this is the case in the resting system; for we have not yet
	furnished the proof that the principle of the constancy of the
	velocity of light is compatible with the principle of relativity.
\end{quote}
It looks as if Einstein takes a compatibility proof in this case to mean
that we assume only that light moves at $c$ in resting system $K$, as required by
the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light, but \emph{prove} on this
assumption that light moves at $c$ in moving system $\kappa$, as required by the
principle of relativity. ssume the principle of the constancy of the velocity of light in
the resting system, prove
	Or to put the point in the
terms that he himself uses to introduce the proof: he takes a compatibility
proof in this case to require that we assume only that light move at $c$ in
$K$, but \emph{prove} on that assumption that light move at $c$ in $\kappa$.

Looks as if we can assume both without contradiction, so the two principles
are compatible. Why doesn't Einstein do it this way? Without the derivation.

Note as well that the derivation seems to be if light moves at c in K,
it will moves at c in kappa. We don't assume both at once, but just that
light moves at c in K, then "find out" through the derivation that it
travels at c in kappa.
Answer, there is something in the first principle left out of the proof, that
makes the principles seem to be incompatible.

Circularity would seem to be that we assume light travels at c in kappa. But
Einstein assumes this in his actual approach.

Put the point this way: Einstein makes no assumption that the principle
of relativity holds for the transformation equations insofar as they
are transformation equations. Instead the assumption is: if light
travels at velocity c in kappa as measured in kappa, then it will not travel
at c as measured in K. Or the other way around, if light travels at
velocity c in kappa as measured in K, it will not travel at c in kappa
as measured in K.

\section{Derivation}\label{sec:Derivation}
Reverting back to equations \S3.11--14, we solve for the $K$
coordinates as follows:
\begin{align}
 \tau&=\phi(v)\beta\left(t-\frac{vx}{c^2}\right)\\
 \tau&=\phi(v)\beta t - \phi(v)\beta\frac{vx}{c^2}\\
\phi(v)\beta\frac{vx}{c^2}+\tau&=\phi(v)\beta t\\
\frac{vx}{c^2}+\frac{\tau}{\phi(v)\beta}&=t\label{eq:t}\\
\xi&=\phi(v)\beta(x-vt)\\
\xi&=\phi(v)\beta x -\phi(v)\beta vt\\
\phi(v)\beta vt+\xi&=\phi(v)\beta x\\
vt+\frac{\xi}{\phi(v)\beta}&=x\label{eq:x}\\
\eta&=\phi(v)y\\
\frac{\eta}{\phi(v)}&=y\label{eq:finaly}\\
\zeta&=\phi(v)z\\
\frac{\zeta}{\phi(v)}&=z\label{eq:finalz}
\end{align}
To eliminate the embedded $K$ coordinates that remain in
equations (\ref{eq:t}) and (\ref{eq:x}), we can substitute
(\ref{eq:x}) for $x$ in (\ref{eq:t}) and (\ref{eq:t}) for $t$
in (\ref{eq:x}). Solving again for $t$:
\begin{align}
  \frac{v\left(vt+\frac{\xi}{\phi(v)\beta}\right)}{c^2}+\frac{\tau}{\phi(v)\beta}&=t\\
  \frac{v^2t+\frac{v\xi}{\phi(v)\beta}}{c^2}+\frac{\tau}{\phi(v)\beta}&=t\\
  \frac{v^2t}{c^2}+\frac{v\xi}{\phi(v)\beta c^2}+\frac{\tau}{\phi(v)\beta}&=t\\
  \frac{v\xi}{\phi(v)\beta c^2}+\frac{\tau}{\phi(v)\beta}&=t-\frac{v^2t}{c^2}\\
  \frac{v\xi}{\phi(v)\beta c^2}+\frac{\tau}{\phi(v)\beta}&=t\left(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)\\
  \frac{1}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\left(\frac{v\xi}{\phi(v)\beta c^2}+\frac{\tau}{\phi(v)\beta}\right)&=t\\
  \beta^2\left(\frac{v\xi}{\phi(v)\beta c^2}+\frac{\tau}{\phi(v)\beta}\right)&=t\\
  \frac{\beta v\xi}{\phi(v)c^2}+\frac{\beta\tau}{\phi(v)}&=t\\
  \intertext{or} \frac{\frac{\beta
      v\xi}{c^2}+\beta\tau}{\phi(v)}&=t\\
  \frac{\beta(\frac{v\xi}{c^2}+\tau)}{\phi(v)}&=t\label{eq:finalt}.
\end{align}
And solving again for $x$:
\begin{align}
v\left(\frac{vx}{c^2}+\frac{\tau}{\phi(v)\beta}\right)+\frac{\xi}{\phi(v)\beta}&=x\\
\frac{v^2x}{c^2}+\frac{v\tau}{\phi(v)\beta}+\frac{\xi}{\phi(v)\beta}&=x\\
\frac{v\tau}{\phi(v)\beta}+\frac{\xi}{\phi(v)\beta}&=x-\frac{v^2x}{c^2}\\
\frac{v\tau}{\phi(v)\beta}+\frac{\xi}{\phi(v)\beta}&=x\left(1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)\\
\frac{1}{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}\left(\frac{v\tau}{\phi(v)\beta}+\frac{\xi}{\phi(v)\beta}\right)&=x\\
\beta^2\left(\frac{v\tau}{\phi(v)\beta}+\frac{\xi}{\phi(v)\beta}\right)&=x\\
\frac{\beta v\tau + \beta \xi}{\phi(v)}&=x\\
\frac{\beta(v\tau + \xi)}{\phi(v)}&=x\label{eq:finalx}
\end{align}
Now we plug (\ref{eq:finalx}), (\ref{eq:finalt}),
(\ref{eq:finalz}), and (\ref{eq:finaly}) back into \S 3.16:
\begin{align}
  \left(\frac{\beta(v\tau +
      \xi)}{\phi(v)}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\eta}{\phi(v)}\right)^2+\left(\frac{\zeta}{\phi(v)}\right)^2&=c^2\left(\frac{\beta(\frac{v\xi}{c^2}+\tau)}{\phi(v)}\right)^2\\
  \frac{\beta^2(v\tau +
    \xi)^2}{\phi^2(v)}+\frac{\eta^2}{\phi^2(v)}+\frac{\zeta^2}{\phi^2(v)}&=c^2\left(\frac{\beta^2(\frac{v\xi}{c^2}+\tau)^2}{\phi^2(v)}\right)\\
  \left(\frac{\phi^2(v)}{\beta^2(\frac{v\xi}{c^2}+\tau)^2}\right)\left(\frac{\beta^2(v\tau + \xi)^2+\eta^2+\zeta^2}{\phi^2(v)}\right)&=c^2\\
  \left(\frac{\phi^2(v)}{\beta^2(\frac{v\xi}{c^2}+\tau)^2}\right)\left(\frac{\beta^2\left[(v\tau + \xi)^2+\frac{\eta^2}{\beta^2}+\frac{\zeta^2}{\beta^2}\right]}{\phi^2(v)}\right)&=c^2\\
\frac{(v\tau +
    \xi)^2+\frac{\eta^2}{\beta^2}+\frac{\zeta^2}{\beta^2}}{(\frac{v\xi}{c^2}+\tau)^2}&=c^2\\
  (v\tau +
  \xi)^2+\frac{\eta^2}{\beta^2}+\frac{\zeta^2}{\beta^2}&=c^2\left(\frac{v\xi}{c^2}+\tau\right)^2\\
  (v\tau +
  \xi)^2+\frac{\eta^2}{\beta^2}+\frac{\zeta^2}{\beta^2}&=c^2\left(\frac{v^2\xi^2}{c^4}+\frac{2\tau
    v \xi}{c^2} + \tau^2 \right)\\
  (v\tau +
  \xi)^2+\frac{\eta^2}{\beta^2}+\frac{\zeta^2}{\beta^2}&=\frac{v^2\xi^2}{c^2}+2\tau
    v \xi + c^2\tau^2\\
v^2\tau^2 +
